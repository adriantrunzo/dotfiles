# dotfiles

My dotfiles, mainly based around vim, git and ghostty. Please feel free to copy
anything you find useful into your own dotfiles.

## Usage

I use [dotbot](https://github.com/anishathalye/dotbot) to manage my dotfiles.

### Install

    git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/adriantrunzo/dotfiles.git
    cd dotfiles
    ./install 

Regardless of where you cloned the dotfiles, this install will create symlinks
in your home directory to the appropriate dotfiles.
